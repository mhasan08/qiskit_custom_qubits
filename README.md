# Qubits with custom state vector in qiskit

Code related to qubits in pre-defined or custom states in qiskit. Such scenarios are useful in near quantum devices. 

The code includes:
<ul>
  <li>qubits in arbitrary state (single or multiple qubits) </li>
  <li>custom circuit from defined qubit/s</li>
  <li>custom operator(of course unitary) for the quantum circuit</li>
  <li>measurement and simulation</li>
</ul>
